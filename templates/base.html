          <h1>Versatile and Robust Java</h1>
          <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language created by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton, dedicated employees of Sun Microsystems, with the help of Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems in 1982), presented officially on May 23, 1995, at SunWorld. The Sun company was then acquired in 2009 by the Oracle company which now owns and maintains Java. It was invented as a language for digital devices such as televisions, set-top boxes, etc later it is used in mobile devices, games, internet programming, etc. Spericorn decided to show trust in JAVA due to its great and commendable performance inspired by C and C++ and its multithreading capability. In addition to this various other reasons makes JAVA a perfect choice like its robust, secure, and simple feature, independent and multi-platform support. <br>Spericorn is the top Java development company with a â€˜no-compromiseâ€™ approach towards quality.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its â€˜write once, run anywhereâ€™ (WORA) methodology, Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications as its applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. The primary goals of the Java language are for it to be simple, object-oriented, and familiar; robust and secure; architecture-neutral and portable; high performance; and interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key feature in Javaâ€™s design is security and it is characterized for safe programming which is free of corruption or infection. Taking advantage of the multifaceted characters of the technology, Spericorn has positioned itself as a top Java development company that uses the language to successfully facilitate a number of development process including desktop GUI applications, embedded systems, web applications, front and back office electronic trading systems, settlement and confirmation systems, data processing projects, and much more.</span></p>

						<h1>Speedy and Stable PHP</h1>
						<p>It is a free " programming language ", mainly used to produce dynamic web pages via an HTTP server but can also function like any other language. PHP is an object- oriented imperative language. The PHP language was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 for his website. It was invented to accelerate the bug reporting and to improve code. There are several reasons why Spericorn decided to include PHP in its technology stack, its free of cost service, its interaction with a lot of database languages and also easy to set up features. <br>Make benefit of the best PHP development company for a stable and dynamic web solution for your company.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> is an open-source general-purpose scripting language that is widely used for web development and can be embedded into HTML. What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client, who would receive the results of running that script.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP is extremely simple to learn for a newcomer, but also offers many advanced features for professional programmers in PHP development companies. Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, much more can be achieved with it. Also, PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many Unix variants, Microsoft Windows, iOS, and probably others. PHP also has support for most of the web servers today, and so with PHP, you have the freedom of choosing any operating system and a web server.</span></p>
